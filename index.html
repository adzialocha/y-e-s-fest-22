        <p data-fold-content="jessie">Jessie Marino is a composer, performer, and media artist from Long Island, New York. her work explores the repetition inside common activities, ritualistic absurdities, and uncovering nostalgic technologies. Jessie’s pieces score out sound, video, physical movements, lighting, and staging, which are then placed within organized temporal structures, fractured narratives and musical frameworks. Much of marino’s interdisciplinary compositional work eschews conventional instrumentation, with scores that ask performers to use their bodies—using precisely articulated gestures, facial expressions, and quotidian physical movements—both as an alternative and a complement to musical sounds. <a href="https://www.jessiemarino.com" target="_blank">https://www.jessiemarino.com</a></p>

        <strong data-fold-header="bag">BAG collective (Annegret Schalke, Maya Weinberg, Natal Igor Dobkin)</strong>
        <p data-fold-content="bag">BAG is a collective composed of 6 choreographer-performers based in Berlin. Maya Weinberg and Roni Katz come from Israel, Xenia Taniko and Annegret Schalke are from Germany, Lisa Densem comes from New Zealand, and Manon Parent from France. Their wish to work together as a collective originated in a collaboration that was surrounding the choreographic proposal of Roni Katz in 2018 (A Matter of One’s Own) during which they realized the potential of their multidisciplinary and complementary skills. While they are all professional choreographers and dancers, each of them also has an additional professional activity which ranges from music to costume design, dramaturgy to light design. Their shared interests revolve around the ideas of social cohesion through sharing their practice, adaptation to multiple contexts and collecting stories. This “collecting” aspect is what gave the collective its name in 2020, B A G. Inspired by Ursula K. Le Guin's “the carrier bag theory of fiction”, they decided to see their creating as an ever-transforming, sponge-like process, rather than a fixed form that would be seen at some point as a finished object. <a href="http://bag-collective.de/" target="_blank">http://bag-collective.de</a></p>
