      <h1>Hallo Y-E-S Fest 22!</h1>
      <p>On the <strong>10th and 11th of September</strong> the <a href="https://y-e-s.org" target="_blank">Y-E-S collective</a> invites to the second edition of the Y-E-S Fest, taking place in and around the Heizhaus of the <strong>Uferstudios in Berlin</strong>. The program includes interdisciplinary performances to be read freely as music, dance, performative acts or/and interventions in public space.</p>
      <p>For example: workshops on the intersecting of the botanical and musical work of Hildegard von Bingen, and on creative activism in colonized vacation areas; an installation transferring the architecture of public space into sound; a rehearsal-performance on the choreography of demonstrations; as well as live music acts.</p>
      <div class="icons"></div>
      <h2>Workshop invitation üõº</h2>
      <p>On the afternoon of September 10th and 11th, as part of the Y-E-S Fest program three <strong>free workshops</strong> will be held in the Heizhaus of Ufer Studios: Pulp Suede Blur by the Berliner B A G collective (Annegret Shalke, Maya Weinberg, Nattan Igor Dobkin), Song of Herbs by singer and herbalist Atalya Tirosh and Tour Operator by the Sardinian C.A.S.C.A.T.A collective.</p>
      <p class="workshop">The workshops are open to all, no previous knowledge required. For question and registration, write to <a href="mailto:mail@y-e-s.org">mail@y-e-s.org</a> by Sept. 5th.</p>

        <p data-fold-content="feld">Lucien Danzeisen and Lennart Melzer share different projects: With "FELD_", they created a site-specific composition with an open form: 347 GPS spots=soundfiles on Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin. See feld.zerkabelt.de for more infos. As "teaser", the duo plays experimental music between improvisation, concepts and compositions, using different setups, including acoustic and electronical instruments and live-coding. For Y-E-S Fest, they bring these two artistic practices together, in field:teaser, which is both a concert and a site-specific sound-installation. <a href="https://teaser.zerkabelt.de" target="_blank">https://teaser.zerkabelt.de</a></p>

        <p data-fold-content="pulp">In this workshop the collective of choreographers B A G invites the participants to see and experience physical space though a lens of blurriness. Within our project LANDERS we were exploring ways of shifting our perception in order to sense our everyday surrounding anew. Masking our gaze with grainy transparent filters allows us to see the world around us as an abstract image of colors and blended shapes. What happens when all edges are softened? What disappears and what sticks out? What do we hear? How do we orient ourselves? How does a blurred vision put us in motion and emotion? Which narratives arise? We will dive together into a countour-less performative space, a theatre of light, sound and movement. <a class="signup" href="mailto:mail@y-e-s.org">Sign up!</a></p>

        <strong>Maikon K ~ Performance</strong>
        <p>The core focus of his work is the body and its capacity to change perceptions, influenced by a shamanic perspective in which the performer unfolds himself into several different realities through specific body techniques, using song, non-verbal sound, dance, visual signs and ritualized activities. Your interests are states of consciousness, dark humor, the relation sacred-profane, sexuality, intensities, grotesque, to provoke rituals, to test sensibilities.</p>
        <strong>Marcela Lucatelli ~ "I am a golden god"</strong>
        <p>In Marcela Lucatelli's ‚ÄúI Am a Golden God‚Äù the artist takes us into a synth-pop journey and shakes loose the narratives of progress contained in it. By way of Lucatelli, machine and human are a sole organism and we are invited into the cracks of the technology. A wrestling match between her intensely corporeal vocalisations and the synths capacities for sonic dominance, ‚ÄúI Am a Golden God‚Äù shreds, exposes and tenderly caresses the legacy of modernism as Western, technocratic and contingent. In so doing, it opens the cages for the colonial ghosts of monumentalism that have held back liberatory potential for new ways of living the movement contained.</p>
